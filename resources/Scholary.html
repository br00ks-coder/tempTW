      	<h3>Contribution</h3>
      	<h2>Mihail Filimon</h2>
      	<p>
          My contributions to the first part of the project resume in:
            <ul>
              <li>designing the template of almost every web page.</li>
              <li>designing the main page of the website.</li>
              <li>making a media responsive layout.</li>
            </ul>
      	</p>
        <br>
      	<h2>Alexandru Balan</h2>
      	<p>
      		Based on the index template I made the register page for the website. There users input email, password and confirm password. After checking if the passwords are the same and email is not in use the user is allowed to register and stored.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		The login page was also made by me, if someone tries to login, login.js tries to check if the user and password match and allow to login if they are successful. If not he is returned a message with the error.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		Other pages that had me involved were contact, profile, about, check, buy.
